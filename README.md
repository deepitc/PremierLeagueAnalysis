# Premier League Stats Analysis

The Premier League Stats Analysis Project is a comprehensive study of the statistical data from the last 10 years of the Premier League. 
By analyzing this data, we aim to understand the current performance of teams in the Premier League and how it relates to their cumulative data from the past decade. 
This analysis will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each team, as well as the trends and patterns that have emerged over time. 
Through this project, we hope to provide a deeper understanding of the Premier League and its teams, and to provide a basis for future predictions and analysis.
